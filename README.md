# Basic setup of a gulp-sass workflow

This folder is a "base" to start working with a gulp workflow using sass and node.js.

The intention of this Repository is have a ready to go workflow setup that requires you to follow the instructions in the [Start](START.md) file to begin your development. As the creation of the workflow is a repetitive time consuming task.

I will update this repository when new versions of the dependecies appear.

The source files already contain some code within it such as mixins and a basic reset.

## Notes

11/04/23 - This workflow will work with the gulp-imagemin dependency version 7.1.0. If you use version 8 or superior you will need to modify the gulpfile. (Will be updated ASAP).
